## üìÇ Projects in this Repository

### 1. **Chat with Multiple PDFs**
An interactive application that allows users to upload multiple PDF files, extract their content, and interact with the system using a conversational AI interface. Ask questions related to the PDF content, and the AI will provide answers based on the extracted information.

#### Key Features:
- Upload and process multiple PDFs.
- Text extraction using **PyPDF2**.
- Split the extracted text into manageable chunks using **LangChain**.
- Use **FAISS** for semantic search of relevant chunks.
- Interactive Q&A with the **Google Generative AI** model.
- Built with **Streamlit** for the frontend interface.
